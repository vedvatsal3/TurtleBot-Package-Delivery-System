# Robot Package Delivery Project – S

## Overview
This project was implemented as part of a university subject and is **still under construction**.  
The primary goal is to develop and simulate a robot delivery system using TurtleBot4 and ROS 2, integrating navigation, behavior trees and a cool user interface where a server node autonomously controls the environment while controlling which robot to choose for delivery depending on battery status and similar destination.

## Repository Structure
- **`ss-25-secoro-assignments-team-2/secoro_ws`** –  
  This is the **main workspace** containing everything required to run the simulation.  
- **Assignments** –  
  Each assignment folder contains:
  1. **`task.md`** – Description of all tasks for that assignment.
  2. **`submission_files/`** – Corresponding files submitted for that assignment.  
  These are included so that viewers can explore the step-by-step progress and development process.
- **`worksheets/`** – A collection of worksheets covering the entire implementation and assignments, serving as a reference and study material.

## Resources Used
- **TurtleBot4 Manual**: [https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/software/turtlebot4_common.html](https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/software/turtlebot4_common.html)  
- **Behavior Trees**: [https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.ROS2](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.ROS2)

## Installation & Setup
All guides for initial installation, dependencies, and running the simulation are provided in the **`installation_instructions`** folder. The task specific workflow can be found in the worksheets.
Follow these step-by-step to set up your environment and run the project successfully.

## Current Status
- Core simulation environment inclusive of spawnning of 2 turtlebot4 & docking stations, navigation, localization and user interface set up in ROS 2 Jazzy with TurtleBot4.
- Basic navigation and behavior tree integration in progress.
- Additional features and improvements planned for upcoming updates.

## Notes
While **`secoro_ws`** is the main workspace to get the project running, the assignments and worksheets are highly recommended for those who wish to understand the development journey, task requirements, and problem-solving methods applied throughout the course.
