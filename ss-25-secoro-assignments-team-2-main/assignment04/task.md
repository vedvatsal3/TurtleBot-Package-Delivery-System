# Assignment 04

As you now have a functional prototype running in simulation, this assignment focuses on **testing** the behaviors and **validating** them in the real world against the requirements specified in earlier assignments.

## Objective

The goal of this phase is to ensure that your multi-robot delivery system behaves **reliably** and meets the specified requirements under various scenarios. Validating the system against acceptance criteria increases confidence in its readiness for further development and real-world deployment

## Task

1. **Specify the functional and performance tests**, along with the respective metrics used. Justify your choice of metrics and explain how each test relates to the defined requirements
2. **Test the acceptance criteria** in both simulation and **on the real robot**. Describe the measures taken to **automate** the tests and ensure their **reproducibility**
3. **Analyze the test results** and map them to the defined requirements. Justify how the results validate the systemâ€™s compliance with those requirements

## Deliverables

1. **Test specification**
    - A list of functional and performance tests, including their mapping to the requirements
    - The metrics used for each test, along with justification for their selection
2. **Test implementation** 
	- Scripts or launch files to execute the automated tests
	- Description and procedure for executing each test
	- Links to the ROS bag files containing relevant topic messages for each test
3. **Test analysis**
    - A concise report presenting the test results and associated metrics, showing the outcome of each test
    - A mapping of test results to the original system requirements 
    - Description of any failing tests, how they will be handled during the deployment, and with any other issues encountered

**Note:** 
- All materials related to this assignment must be submitted by **10:00 HRS on June 30th, 2025**, to the `submission_files` folder under the respective assignment.
